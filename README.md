# e-mission-docs

This repository contains all the documentation for the e-mission project, and
almost all the issues. There are some specialized `README`s in the individual
repositories, but they are gradually being moved in here. This means that if
you have any questions, you should first search here


and if you don't find any existing issues, you should file an issue here.

If you want to help improve the documentation, please check the
[CONTRIBUTING](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide and submit a pull request. All the
documentation is in markdown, so you can edit and generate pull requests
directly from the browser. No CLI expertise needed!
