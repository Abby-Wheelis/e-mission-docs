# Welcome to the e-mission Documentation!

This repo contains all the documentation for the e-mission project, and [almost all the issues](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-docs/issues/). More information on the rationale behind the change can be found in the [migration reasons](https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-docs/blob/master/docs/migration_reason.md).

This page is an entry point to all the doc in the repo. An HTML version of the doc is to be generated in the coming weeks (Summer 2019).

There are some specialized READMEs in the individual repositories, but they are gradually being moved in here. This means that if you have any questions, you should first search here and if you don't find any existing issues, you should file an issue here.

## What is e-mission
E-mission is an open source software developed at UC Berkeley EECS Lab.  
E-mission includes a mobile application for Android and iOS collects automatically the users tracks and sends them to the server so as to derive personal mobility information and analyses ; depending on user consent for sharing his/her data, the data can also be used for aggregate mobility data studies. The application is also a tool for collecting information filled in by the user (such as incidents, ground truth information about his/her trip purpose and transportation mode, or answers to questions asked in external surveys).  
The server is a python web application, the data is stored in a mongoDB database; 
the client is a Cordova application for both Android and iOS.  
The application has been initially designed to be reused in research and academic projects either for conducting and as a good learning project for CS students. It is also freely reusable for any other user cases (LINK to list to be added here).
