Here's a list of potential open source foundations we can join and the related projects in each.

| Foundation | Related Projects | Notes |
|------------|------------------|-------|
| [Apache](http://incubator.apache.org/)     | Open Climate Workbench | Most other projects are middleware related, need to find a champion + mentors |
| [Linux UC](https://uc.foundation/#)   | [Mapzen](https://opensourceforu.com/2019/01/open-source-mapping-platform-mapzen-joins-linux-foundation/), [CARTO](https://carto.com/blog/urban-computing-foundation/) | Most of the TAC seems to be from Big Tech companies, except UCSD |
| [Eclipse openMobility Working Group](https://openmobility.eclipse.org/) | Eclipse SUMO, Eclipse MUSTANG | Mustang recently joined (Oct 2019), both seem to be simulation-based |
| [Open Mobility Foundation](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/) | Open spec (MDS) focuse on micro-mobility, want to expand to other areas | Lots of cities involved, and want to broaden scope beyond micro-mobility |
| [Open Transit Software Foundation](https://opentransitsoftwarefoundation.org) | One Bus Away | One Bus Away developers and agencies |
| [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) | Open Trip Planner | ??? |
| [Urban Data Science Toolkit](https://github.com/UDST) | UrbanSim | Foundation under consideration |

Looks like the general trend in the transportation world is to make a new non-profit for each piece of open source software, instead of working with umbrella organizations like in computing. Maybe this is because open source projects are so novel in the domain that people wait until there is sufficient critical mass to create the nonprofit.
