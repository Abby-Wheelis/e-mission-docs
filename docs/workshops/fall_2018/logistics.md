## e-mission workshop: understanding and influencing human travel behavior (logistics) ##

### Pre-requisites ###
-------
For the most efficient use of everybody's time, please do these *before* the start of the conference.

#### Collect some data to explore ####
In order to get a sense of how e-mission works and what the data looks like,
please install the app and collect data *before* the workshop. On the evening
session of the first day (_e-mission overview_) you will download and
experiment with the data you have collected.

You can choose from different possible UI _clients_ or _skins_.
- Standard e-mission app: http://e-mission.eecs.berkeley.edu/
- Travel survey from [CCI Berkeley](http://communityinnovation.berkeley.edu/) with popup mode/purpose: https://e-mission.eecs.berkeley.edu/#/client_setup?new_client=cci&clear_usercache=true&clear_local_storage=true
- Spanish version of the above, from [Megumi Yamanaka](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/city-regional-planning/people/phd-students/megumi-yamanaka): https://e-mission.eecs.berkeley.edu/#/client_setup?new_client=megumibrt&clear_usercache=true&clear_local_storage=true
- Travel survey with detailed trip info collected using qualtrics: https://e-mission.eecs.berkeley.edu/#/client_setup?new_client=interscity&clear_usercache=true&clear_local_storage=true

#### Sign up for github ####
e-mission is hosted on [github](http://github.com/), so you will use github to
download the code and submit improvements. We will also use github for the
(asychronous discussion system)[#asynchronous-participation]. After you sign up
for github, please send me your github username (e.g. @shankari) via email so that I can add you
to the e-mission organization and you can participate in the online discussion.

#### Required reading/viewing ####
Will be updated before Sunday PDT

### Asynchronous participation ###
-------
As of 18th Aug 2018, ~ 50% of the registered participants will be remote, and
we have participants from 5 continents (North America, South America, Europe,
Asia and Australia). This makes it impossible to schedule the conference at a
time that is not in the middle of the night in some timezone. In order to allow
all participants to participate fully, we will support asynchronous
participation, inspired by this [Nearly Carbon Neutral
Conference (NCNC)](http://hiltner.english.ucsb.edu/index.php/ncnc-guide/#content).
As outlined in the NCNC guide, we will:
- record all the sessions and make them available for viewing at any time.
  Since all the sessions are expected to be highly interactive, the recordings
  will largely reflect the participation of in-person attendees.
- support online discussions on each of the sessions. This will allow remote
  attendees to participate, and will also allow in-person attendees to post
  follow-ups.
    - In order to keep the online discussion *high-quality*, we will use [github dicussions](https://help.github.com/articles/about-team-discussions/) and
only attendees who have registered and sent me their github handle will be able
to participate.
    - In order to ensure that the online discussion is *timely*, the asynchronous
      participation period will run for **one month ONLY**. On **Thursday, September 20th**,
      2018, the discussions will be turned off.
